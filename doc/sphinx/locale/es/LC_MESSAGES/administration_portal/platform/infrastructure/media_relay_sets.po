"Media relays are in charge of bridging RTP traffic of established calls. "
"Like the Application Servers, they can scale horizontally as much as "
"required."

"Media relays are organized in groups so they can be assigned to a "
"client/provider. Each element of the group has a **metric** that allows "
"non-equal load balancing within the same group (i.e. media-relay1 metric "
"1; media-relay2 metric 2: the second media relay will handle two times "
"the calls than the first one)."

"The static assignment of media relay groups is not the common practice "
"but allow us to assign strategic resources to clients that need a "
"warranted service. The most common usage of this **groups of media "
"relays** is to place them near the geographic area of the client (usually"
" far from the rest of the platform systems) in order to reduce "
"**latencies** in their conversations."

"The address displayed is the control socket, not the SDP address that "
